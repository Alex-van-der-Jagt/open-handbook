# Collect & Store 

## Data Collection

Data collection may consist of the re-use of existing data and/or the generation of new data. You can find more specific information on the re-use of existing data on the [Finding Existing Data](http://libguides.vu.nl/researchdata/finding-existing-data) page in this LibGuide

For data to be considered valid and reliable, data collection should occur consistently and systematically throughout the course of the research project. Data collection guidelines and established methodologies should be used to gather data. Some disciplines make use of codebooks, whereas others use protocols for data gathering. These procedures help researchers collect data according to conventional methodological steps. If a research project involves multiple partners (in a consortium) it should be clear who is responsible for the collection of what (part of the) data. Important aspects of data collection include:

*   Standardisation: [codebooks](https://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/codebooks) & [protocols](https://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/data-collection#s-lg-box-wrapper-17896154)
*   Structure / organisation of the data
*   [Data quality assurance methods](https://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/data-processing)
*   [Documentation](http://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/data-documentation) & [metadata](http://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/metadata)
*   [Storage](http://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/data-storage) & [protection](http://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/data-protection)

This relates to the Reproducibility of your research according to the [FAIR-data principles](//libguides.vu.nl/rdm/overview#s-lg-box-wrapper-17896126).

### Data Collection Tools

The tools being used in research to collect data are immensely diverse. For that reason, we will not provide an exhaustive overview here. What is important for data collection tools in relation to RDM is where such tools store the data that you collect and in which format. The storage location is particularly important when you are working with personal data. For example, the privacy legislation in the United States is very different from the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Hence, personal data collected in a Dutch research institute may not be stored on American servers. It is important to keep that in mind when you are contemplating which tool to use for your data collection.

If you are collecting personal data and you decide to use a tool for which no contract exists between VU Amsterdam and the provider of the software or tool, a service agreement and a processing agreement must be drawn up. Contact the [](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[privacy champion](https://vu.nl/en/employee/privacy-and-information-security/privacy-champions-information) of your faculty for more information and a model processing agreement.

**Questionnaire tools**

The Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences has developed a [document with tips for safe use](https://fgb-rdm.nl/Images/Secure_Use_of_Questionnaire_Tools.pdf) of the questionnaire tools Qualtrics and Survalyzer. The document was made for FGB researchers specifically but can also be helpful for others. Consult this document if you need a questionnaire tool to collect your data.


### Data Collection in Collaboration

Some research projects involve the participation of multiple organisations or institutes and may include even cross-border co-operation. When data is collected by several organisations, a Data Management Plan should provide information on who is responsible for which part of the data collection and storage. It should also provide information on how specific data collections are related to which part(s) of the research goal(s). Describing this precisely will help you to determine if a consortium agreement or joint controller agreement is necessary. You see a general example of such a specification in the table below:

| Data Stage | Dataset description                 | Responsible organization for collection                | Data origin                     | Data purpose                                                                               |
|------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Raw data   | Community level surveys             | Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam                           | Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam | Identifying perceived problems, System responsiveness                                      |
| Raw data   | Trials &amp; Focus Group Interviews | London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) | Germany, Switzerland            | Trials to evaluate programs on . . ., Focus Group interviews to identify barriers to . . . |
| Raw data   | Pollution measurements using fish   | Oceanographic Institute of Sweden                      | Coastal waters, Northeast Spain | Establish pollution levels of plastic                                                      |


### Data Collection Protocols

Regardless of the field of study or preference for defining data (quantitative, qualitative), accurate data collection is essential to maintaining the integrity (structure) of research. Both the selection of appropriate data collection instruments (existing, modified, or newly developed) and clearly delineated instructions for their correct use reduce the likelihood of errors.

There are two approaches for reducing and/or detecting errors in data which can help to preserve the integrity of your data and ensure scientific validity. These are:

1.  **Quality assurance** - activities that take place **before** data collection begins
2.  **Quality control** - activities that take place **during and after** data collection

Quality assurance precedes data collection and its main focus is 'prevention' (i.e., forestalling problems with data collection). Prevention is the most cost-effective activity to ensure the integrity of data collection. This proactive measure is best demonstrated by the standardization of protocol developed in a comprehensive and detailed procedures manual for data collection.

While quality control activities (detection/monitoring and action) occur during and after data collection, the details should be carefully documented in the procedures manual. A clearly defined communication structure is a necessary pre-condition for monitoring and tracking down errors. Quality control also identifies the required responses, or ‘actions’ necessary to correct faulty data collection practices and also minimise future occurrences.

## Data Storage

### Storage During Research

![](//libapps-eu.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/46351/images/storage.gif)

Many storage options exist that can be used for research data. Depending on the conditions and scope of the research the choices may be broader or narrower. The choices may depend on factors like:

*   Does a project involve multiple organisations or departments?
*   The sensitivity of the data: does it involve personal data or copyrighted / commercial data?
*   Are any commercial parties involved?
*   Does the research project involve multiple locations (multinational, even)?
*   Will there be (lab) devices producing data that need to be stored as well?
*   What will be the volume of the data?
*   Will there be lots of interactions with the data (using software/tools)?

Many solutions exist and may be used:

*   Local storage on computers/networks
*   Data storage by creating a shared database on a server
*   Specific locations where physical data samples are stored
*   A powerful (cloud-based) High Performance Computer

Researchers and PhD students have multiple options that can be used, some of which are listed below. More information about these storage options is available behind their respective links. It is also possible to ask the [Research Data Services team](mailto:rdm@vu.nl) for advice or, in case of complex projects, the [](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[relationship manager](https://vu.nl/en/employee/research-support/contact-research-support) from the IT domain team for research.


### Local Storage & Protection

VU IT and the department IT for Research (ITvO) offer several services for both employees and students to store the data that are being collected and used during research. Examples of local storage options are:

*   **[](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[Group (network) drives](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=525eda9f978f09d0e553359fe153afaa).** Most departments of faculties at the university will already have group drives or folders available to them. A research project may require strict limitations on who has access to specific folders or drives for sensitive data. Contact IT via the [](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[selfservice portal](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=vu_it_ecp_dashboard) to discuss your requirements. **Note:** The Home and Group drives will be phased in the course of 2022/2023 and the university will shift to using Microsoft 365 (OneDrive and Sharepoint) as default storage. A security classification for these systems is not yet available, so we cannot give advice yet about if these are good places to store (potentially) sensitive data. Research Drive or Yoda (see [below](https://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/data-storage?#s-lg-box-wrapper-15125671)) is a better option to store sensitive data.  
     
*   [](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[**SciStor**](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=86ad5a5f978f09d0e553359fe153afb3) (short for ‘Storage for Scientists’): This option allows for inexpensive storage of large files. There are various levels of security possible and various ways to get access to the files. SciStor is only intended for ongoing research, not for archiving.

An **overview of storage and file transfer options** is available below and online as the [Storage finder](https://vu.nl/en/research/storagefinder). This overview and/or the storage finder will help you to choose the storage option most suitable to your research. In the left column, you will find criteria about the research and the data. The matrix shows you what storage options meet these criteria. You can then choose the appropriate storage option based on your needs. Please make use of the RDM Support Desk and/or your local data stewards to get help on which tool to pick, particularly when working with confidential, sensitive and/or personal data

### Protected Cloud Storage & File sharing

A number of research projects will involve researchers from multiple organisations. It may also ![](//libapps-eu.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/46351/images/CloudSecurity.jpg)involve researchers from multiple countries. Developments in cloud-based solutions go fast and many options are available these days. When selecting a cloud-based service it is important to remember to check **where** the data will be hosted. If the research project involves sensitive data it may be necessary to choose cloud-based options that guarantee that the data will stay in Europe or on European-based servers.

*   [**Yoda**](https://yoda.vu.nl/site/index.html) (short for Your Data) is a cloud storage at SURF and is suitable for storing large-scale and sensitive datasets. Yoda also supports collaborating on projects in and outside the VU and adding contextual information ([metadata](https://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/metadata)) about your dataset as you go. Yoda is the best choice if your research is very sensitive.
*   [](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[**Research Drive**](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=39d345f097066990e553359fe153af01) is a cloud storage at Surf for research projects and is suitable for collaboration in and outside the VU, for storing sensitive data and large-scale research projects. You can also [encrypt](https://wiki.surfnet.nl/display/RDRIVE/How+to+encrypt+your+files) data in Research Drive using several tools. You are able to request storage space in Research Drive via a [](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[web form](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=39d345f097066990e553359fe153af01) in the selfservice portal (VU employees only). Research Drive is the best choice if you need to manage access rights on a folder level. More general information about Research Drive can be found [here](https://www.surf.nl/en/research-drive-securely-and-easily-store-and-share-research-data), and its wiki pages, including tutorials, are [here](https://wiki.surfnet.nl/display/RDRIVE/Tutorials).
*   There are differences between Research Drive and Yoda and each one may support certain projects better than others. Use the [storage finder](https://vu.nl/en/research/storagefinder) to understand what would be the best choice for your project, and, if you have questions, get in touch with the [RDM Support Desk](mailto:rdm@vu.nl).

*   **[](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[Surf Filesender](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=da7a9e1b978f09d0e553359fe153af98)**: cloud service that allows you to send files of 1 Terabyte to other researchers and encrypted files of up to 250 GB.  
     
*   **[](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[Surfdrive](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=fb4eda9f978f09d0e553359fe153afa5)**: is a personal cloud storage service for the Dutch education and research community, offering staff, researchers and students an easy way to store, synchronise and share files in the secure and reliable SURF community cloud. All users receive storage space of up to 500 GB.  
     
*   **[](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[Zivver](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=01d4a69797cf09d0e553359fe153afdd)**: All employees of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam can use Zivver, the encryption program that allows you to send email or data (sensitive or otherwise) securely by email. Attachments will also be encrypted and can be several Terabyte in size (max = 5 TB). Specific information on how to get and use Zivver are available on the selfservice portal. General explanations on how to use it are available at the [Zivver website](https://docs.zivver.com/en/index.html).  
     
*   **[Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/abwzm/)**: OSF can be used to store data, but it is primarily a tool for data publication and knowledge/research dissemination. The URL in the bullet point leads to more information about how to work with OSF as a VU researcher, but if your question is not answered in the documentation, please [get in touch](mailto:rdm@vu.nl?subject=OSF) with the RDM Support Desk.

## Data Protection

### What is Data Protection?

Protection from what? From whom? When, and why? Before we talk about data protection, let us consider security first. More often than not, 'security' is regarded as a fixed state. In reality, security is an assessment of the level of protection against a certain threat, that you consider to deal with that threat adequately enough. Whether or not security is accurate depends on the value of the data and the quality of protective measures.

The question for you as a researcher is 'when are the measures that you take secure enough?'. In order to answer this, please be aware that there are three entities that have an opinion about what is 'secure enough', namely: the law, the University, and you yourself as the data processor.

The University has a Security Baseline that sets a norm for levels of protection for every application it uses. The Baseline is based on international standards. For each of these applications, the University is considering for which means the security of these applications are adequate enough.

The legal requirements for the processing of personal data can be found in the section 'GDPR and Privacy' under \_Plan & Design\_ There are additional laws and regulations as well. The assumption is that you are familiar with these, especially with laws regulating medical and criminal research.

What you personally consider to be secure might be very different from what your colleagues, the Faculty or the University considers to be secure enough and the norms will vary with the variety of data that is being processed by different researchers and Faculties of the VU. Very generally speaking, there are three points of protection to consider:

1.  Protection against data loss, for which you need a back up periodically.
2.  Protection against data leakage, for which you need to consider all storage places and their access points.
3.  Protection of data integrity, for which you need version control and synchronisation management.

The security of your protection measures depends on the threat you face. We often think of threats as active, and motivated by bad intentions. But most common forms of data loss are accidental and most leakage is caused by trusting others. In reality, devices just get lost or break down, people download malware by accident, and each one of us forgets to save a document at times or gets confused about which version was last updated.

In all cases, protection starts with oversight on where your data is stored and processed. If you forget that you temporarily stored it in a certain place, you have then lost oversight of where that data is. The opposite is also true: if you know where you data is, you have insight in the level of security of the space in which you store it. As you can see, protection begins with organising your work in a reliable manner and thinking through your steps. 

For example, if you data is on your laptop and synchronised with your phone, then it is stored in two places. Perhaps this is enough back up, perhaps not. If you put both you devices in the same bag and you lose your bag, you have no backup. A backup to an online storage might be a good solution, but might also mean your data leaks via the internet of via the storage provider who sells the data and your behavioural data for profit. Most importantly, there is no absolute security. It is best if you consider your personal behaviour and then think of scenarios that are more or less likely to happen and what would impact you most. If you frequently work in public places you should make it a habit to lock your device each time you leave it. If you eat and drink behind your desk often, better work with a remote keyboard to protect your laptop from the unavoidable coffee shower. Do you save your respondents’ contact details on your personal phone? Then protect it with a pin.

Here are some basic protection guidelines:

1.  Data are very difficult to erase. You have probably never done it.
2.  Decide how to back up data and test it before you rely on it.
3.  Do not give others your log-in credentials. If you have done so and your family members use your work device, then change it.
4.  Do not use passwords twice, do not use your birthday, initials, streetname, hobby.
5.  Encryption sounds secure, but it fails completely without good password management.


### Data Protection

There can be many reasons why the data of a project needs to be kept protected:![](//libapps-eu.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/46351/images/20130404encryption.jpg)

*   Sensitivity of the data collected
*   Protection of the research data from competition
*   Commercial reasons / Intellectual property
*   Etc.

There are also many levels of security that may be implemented, depending on the needs. Sometimes it will be enough to use a password-protected cloud-based server. In extreme cases encryption may be needed and also when data is transmitted between researchers or organisations. You should contact the [RDM Support Desk](mailto:rdm@vu.nl) to discuss available options, who may connect you to legal experts where sensitive data is concerned. Check the [Data Storage section of this LibGuide](http://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/data-storage) with links to find out more on campus solutions and cloud-based options.


### Safe Transportation and Transfer

It is important to protect your data during the entire data life cycle. To find out whether your data are secure during all stages of your research, think about your data flow: where do your data originate and where do they go to? If data need to be transported from one physical place to the other, or need to be transferred from one device to another, these actions should happen in a secure way.

#### Transferring digital data

##### Online connection on campus

If data collection takes place through a certain measurement device (e.g. MRI scanner, EEG scanner, eye tracker), the data need to be transferred from the measurement device to the storage location that you will use during your research project. Make sure that this transfer takes place in a secure way and also make a plan for the data on the measurement device; find out whether they need to be destroyed or can remain there.

##### Online connection outside campus (with and without VUnetID)

If you are doing fieldwork outside the campus and you have reliable and secure internet access, it is a good idea to upload the data to a storage location that is regularly backed up and secure, in order to prevent data loss. If you have a VUnetID, you can for example use:

*   [SURFdrive](https://www.surf.nl/en/store-and-share-your-files-securely-in-the-cloud-with-surfdrive) to store your data in a secure cloud service
*   [SURFfilesender](https://www.surf.nl/en/surffilesender-send-large-files-securely-and-encrypted) to send you data to a colleague or consortium partner, who can store your data in an appropriate place

You can find more information about each of these storage options on the [Data Storage](https://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/data-storage) page of this LibGuide.

If you need to receive data from colleagues in your project who don’t have access to these tools (e.g. because they are students, don’t work for a Dutch educational institution, or have no VUnetID), SURFdrive, SURFfilesender and Edugroepen can also be used:

*   [SURFdrive](https://www.surf.nl/en/store-and-share-your-files-securely-in-the-cloud-with-surfdrive): you can set up a ‘File drop’ folder. By sharing the link of this folder to the researchers who need to upload documents, you enable them to do anonymous uploads to this folder. These users have solely upload rights, no view or download rights. The folder can be protected with a password, which you preferably share with the uploaders through another channel.
*   [SURFfilesender](https://www.surf.nl/en/surffilesender-send-large-files-securely-and-encrypted): as a SURFfilesender user, you can send a voucher to someone who doesn’t have access to this tool. This person can use this voucher to send documents to you. These files can be encrypted.
*   [](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[Zivver i](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=01d4a69797cf09d0e553359fe153afdd)s an email plugin with which you can encrypt emails and attachments.

##### Offline data outside campus

If you are doing fieldwork in an area with limited internet access, you might use a portable device to initially store your data during the phase of data collection, such as a USB drive or an external hard drive. These data can be transferred to a storage location that is connected to the internet (e.g. G-drive, SURFdrive) later. Please make sure that the data on such portable devices are secured, by using encryption (and by transporting them safely by using a lockable briefcase or backpack).

#### Transporting physical data

If physical objects need to be transported, you should check with the data manager at your department (if available) what options are available. Special briefcases that can be locked or secure backpacks may need to be used to keep informed consent forms or other sensitive data objects (USB drives etc.) secure during transport.

#### Data transportation and transfer across borders

Some countries have rules to control the movement of encryption technology that enter or exit their borders. If you need to travel with an encrypted laptop to secure your data, for example during fieldwork abroad, please keep this in mind. If you need to transfer data in and out of such countries, please get advice on encryption and secure transportation at the [IT Service Desk](mailto:servicedesk.it@vu.nl).

If you have general questions about how to protect your data when transporting or transferring them, you can contact the [IT Service Desk](mailto:servicedesk.it@vu.nl). In case of complex situations for which you need tailored support, you can consult the IT [](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/off-campus-access)[Relationship Manager](https://vu.nl/en/employee/research-support/contact-research-support) representing the research domain, who can request capacity at IT for setting up an information security plan. Such a plan is usually based on documents which need to be completed beforehand, like a [Data Protection Impact Assessment](//libguides.vu.nl/rdm/data-security#s-lg-box-wrapper-17896144) and a [Data Classification](//libguides.vu.nl/rdm/data-security#s-lg-box-wrapper-17896139). Please note that IT-capacity for tailored support is a paid service for which budget needs to be reserved.
