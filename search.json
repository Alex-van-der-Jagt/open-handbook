    "text": "FAIR Principles\nThe purpose of good data documentation is to facilitate knowledge exchange. The FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016) are the guidelines for every form of research output, and in making data available to others.\nEvery research group should apply these principles when structuring and preserving their data or other research outputs. Making data FAIR involves many aspects of data collection, organization, availability and storage. FAIR does not mean open or public, it means that there is documentation about how access to the data can be achieved.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nWilkinson, Mark D, Michel Dumontier, Ijsbrand Jan Aalbersberg, Gabrielle Appleton, Myles Axton, Arie Baak, Niklas Blomberg, et al. 2016. “The FAIR Guiding Principles for Scientific Data Management and Stewardship.” Sci.

    "text": "Research Data Management\nResearch data management (RDM) concerns the organisation, documentation, storage, archiving and sharing of digital and analogue data. Data management applies throughout the entire research data life cycle, which is visualised in the circle above. RDM aims to ensure reliable verification of results, and permits new and innovative research built on existing information. RDM is also part of the research process and is intended to make the research process as efficient as possible. This LibGuide provides guidance on research data management planning, data storage and protection, data archiving, and other resources. The Data Management Plan provides information on how these activities will be carried out during the research project.\nGood data management will heighten the quality of your own research (data) as well as your institution’s scientific output, and it contributes significantly to your field as a whole.\nGood data management:\n\nPromotes the integrity of your research,\nIncreases the impact of your research,\nImproves the quality of your data,\nSupports future use of your research data, and\nComplies with internal and external regulations."

After planning and design phases, we launched the initial version of the resource at the Research Support Days in May 2024.\nThe Open Handbook centralizes resources that VU researchers need to do their work. The Open Handbook also provides everyone with direct pathways to change resources in case anything has become outdated.\nPreviously such resources were spread out across many different pages at VU and were hard to update. The Open Handbook is curated by us all, and reviewed by specialists. This way we can help each other.\n\n\nThe Open Handbook was initiated by Lena Karvovskaya, Jessica Hrudey, Elisa, and Jolien Scholten. The initial infrastructure for the Open Handbook was built by Liberate Science.\nWe want to specifically call out the following folk who contributed outside of GitHub:\n\nJochem Lybaart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll contributions to this project are gratefully acknowledged using the allcontributors package following the all-contributors specification.

    "text": "Discover & Initiate\nThere are two pages in this section:\nFinding Existing Data: how to find and reuse data that already exist\nData Citation: how to cite data that you use in your research\n\nFinding Existing Data\n\nRe-using Existing Data\nAnything that can be used for analysis can be considered “data(sets)”. Many national and international organisations provide access to large datasets free of charge: this is called Open Data.\nDatasets may contain different kinds of data files, e.g. raw or edited/cleaned data, and macro or micro data. Raw data refers to the data as they are primarily collected, and includes all data, even the missed or mismatched pieces in the data file. Edited or cleaned data refers to data that have been tidied up for analysis and publication. Macro data and statistics are results based on micro data units and provide a general overview of the micro data. Although datasets can contain data of varying type or aggregation level, and there may be overlap between these definitions, each element can contain very important information.\nWhen re-using research data, scientists must be familiar with the rules and regulations governing data copyright, intellectual property rights, and laws governing sensitive or personal information. SURF has compiled a report on the legal status of raw data including information on the types of consent required for the re-use of data. Your Privacy Champion can answer questions about the use of personal data. IXA can provide legal help with the re-use of data.\nSee also the ZonMw explanation of different kinds of property rights in the Netherlands (text available in Dutch only).\n\n\nSources for Finding Existing Datasets\nThe number of datasets that are available grows rapidly. Datasets are made available in many formats, by many people or organizations. Some datasets are raw files and some are specifically organised and formatted as databases that require a licence or subscription to use them. The library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam has collected links to some of the data repositories used and has licensed several databases.\n\nPopular Free and Licensed Databases: These can be found in the library e-resources list or with LibSearch Advanced.\n\nIf you need help finding & using free or licensed sources you can contact the Research Data Services Helpdesk. For students and personnel in the fields of economics, finance, or organisation science a separate LibGuide has been created to help them find and use/re-use data.\nYou can also start looking for data in these four places:\n\nThe literature. Research articles may point you to the data that they are based on. Sometimes, (part of) the data are added to the article as supplementary files, and sometimes the data are published separately in a data repository. In the latter case, the article usually provides a clear reference to the published dataset. Some datasets may even be specifically published in Data Journals.\nScientific data repositories. Data repositories are platforms used to access and archive research data. Universities often provide a repository for data archiving, but other platforms arranged by discipline or by country also exist. Some repositories are only accessible to consortium members, whereas others are free of charge. Many universities in the Netherlands use DataverseNL to archive datasets for the mid-term. Long-term archiving is provided by the national research data archives DANS and 4TU.Research Data. In Europe, B2SHARE and Zenodo are platforms used to access research data. Data repositories can be accessed by searching by topic or country using Re3data, a data repository registry. The VU has its own research portal, PURE, where researchers register their datasets. You can find instructions on how to register your own dataset in PURE on the Dataset Registration page of this LibGuide.\nData search engines. Search engines allow you to quickly browse data sets and supplementary data files published by researchers. They cover data sets from many sources. This makes them useful for quick orientation on a topic. Example of a search engines are: DataCite, Google DataSet Search, Elsevier Dataset Search.\nData portals of (governmental) organisations. Organisations that regularly collect (statistical) data sometimes offer these data through their own portal. An example is Eurostat, which collects and disseminates statistics at the European level, by country and by theme. Some of these websites have been linked in the Finding data LibGuide.\n\n\n\nData Sources for VU Researchers\nResearchers from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam have also developed some databases containing data collected during research. See here for some examples:\n\nNederlands Tweelingenregister (Netherlands Twin Register) The database contains data on twins and their families and was created to do research on the relationship between genetics and growth, development, personality, behaviour, diseases, mental health and all kinds of risks.\nGeoplaza VU - the portal for all matters related to GIS (Geographical Information Systems) and geodata at the VU University Amsterdam. It offers students and employers a platform to exchange, examine and download digital map material.\nDutch monasteries - database with information about Dutch monasteries of the Middle Ages.\nSlave owners in Amsterdam 1863 - the place of living of owners of slaves in Amsterdam in 1863, visualized in GeoPlaza.\nDeaths at the Borders Database - collection of official, state-produced evidence on people who died while attempting to reach southern EU countries from the Balkans, the Middle East, and North & West Africa, and whose bodies were found in or brought to Europe.\nDatasets published by VU Researchers can be found at the VU Research Portal.\n\n\n\n\nData Citation\n\nCitation Elements\nCiting data is not different from citing a publication. Make sure to check the rules of the journal to know how you should cite when writing an article for a specific academic journal. For all of the journals, however, the minimum compulsory elements in a data citation include:\n\nAuthor(s): Name of the author (creator) of the dataset\nTitle: Name of the dataset\nDate of publication\nPublisher: Archive where dataset is stored\nPersistent Identifier: Unique identifier, most common is the DOI (see section Data Publication).\n\nOptional elements that may be included in the reference are:\n\nFile Type: Codebook, movie, software\nVersion: Version number of the edition\nCreation Date\nDate of Consultation (last) Example of a data citation:\n\nStephens, William, 2020, “Resiliences to Radicalisation - QSort Data”, https://doi.org/10.34894/35MTMN, DataverseNL, V1.\nFor more information, see the following guidelines:\n\nDataverse\nDataCite\nDCC UK\nData Citation Synthesis Group (2014).

    "text": "A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document outlining how research data will be handled throughout the research lifecycle. A DMP is a structured way to address data collection, organization, storage, sharing, and preservation. It also outlines the measures taken to ensure data security and addresses how data will be preserved and made available for future use.\n\n\n\nVU Amsterdam offers the online tool DMPonline for writing Data Management Plans. DMPonline is a platform that offers a range of templates, ensuring that researchers can create DMPs to meet the standards of diverse funders and institutions associated with their projects. DMPonline makes it easy to work on a DMP together with colleagues, advisors, or other stakeholders. VU Amsterdam researchers can use the request feedback function of DMPonline to get their DMP reviewed by a faculty data steward or RDM Support Desk colleague.\nIf you have questions about DMPonline, or encounter problems when using the tool, please get in touch with rdm@vu.nl.\n\n\n\nVarious templates exist in which you can set up your DMP. We strongly recommend that you use the VU template, which is called VU DMP template 2021 (NWO & ZonMw certified) v1.4. Below you’ll find an explanation of how to access this template. If you need to write a DMP for funding agencies NWO, ZonMw or ERC, you can use the VU template as well.\n\n\nYou can find the VU DMP template in DMPonline. It includes concise guidance on how to complete your DMP.\nYou can select the VU template by taking the following steps (see also the picture below).\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nFor the question on primary funding organisation, select the check box on the right, saying that no funder is associated with your plan.\n\nNote: Follow these steps as well if you receive funding from NWO or ZonMw (see also below).\n\nIf you’re aiming to write a full DMP based on the VU DMP template, please make sure you don’t select the GDPR registration form.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend researchers to use the VU DMP template whenever possible, especially for researchers who work with personal data. The VU DMP template includes questions that serve as input for the GDPR record of processing activities. This means that when you write a DMP based on the VU DMP template, you simultaneousely comply with the VU requirement to register the personal data you use in your research.\nHowever, it is also possible to use other templates in DMPonline. If your funder or partner organization requires you to use a certain template, it is possible to select that template in DMPonline. Please follow the steps below to select a funder’s template.\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nIn the field under Select the primary funding organisation, start typing the name of your funder and select their template.\n\n\nResearchers who don’t work with personal data and who wish to use another DMP template than the VU template, can also follow the steps above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your research is subject to the GDPR, then you need to register information on your research in a central VU registry. This central registry lists all personal data processing activities carried out at the VU. The registry indicates why and how personal data are processed, and with whom they are shared. The registry helps the VU demonstrate compliance with the GDPR and in the case of a data breach, the registry helps with monitoring and acting swiftly to inform all relevant stakeholders.\nFor research projects, the VU registers data processing via DMPonline. You can create your registration by logging into DMPonline and following the following instructions:\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nFor the question on primary funding organisation, select the check box on the right, saying that no funder is associated with your plan.\n\n\nOnce you get to the two VU templates, you can fill in the VU DMP template 2021 v1.4 if you need to write a DMP anyway; the information you include in this DMP template will be used for the registry. If you don’t need to write a (new) DMP, you can use the separate VU GDPR registration form for research v1.1. Your faculty’s Privacy Champion can help you with your registration.\nIf your research is primarily led by Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc, your research will be registered using their own separate system.\n\n\n\nIf you use personal data in your research, you should register your data processing activities before you start data collection. If you are not sure whether your research data are subject to the GDPR, contact your faculty’s Privacy Champion. Your privacy champion can also assist you if your research is already running, but has not yet been registered.\n\n\n\n\nResearch data is any information that has been collected, observed, generated or created to validate original research findings. Examples of data could be interview recordings, experiment results, physical measurement, notes from focus group’s meetings, notes from fieldwork, observations captured in photographs, film or audio, text files extracted from a corpus, image of archival items or artworks, scraped websites, responses to survey questions. Algorithms, simulations, code, scripts and software are often also considered as research data. There is also physical data: (biological) samples, collections, artifacts etc.\nAdministrative documents, like informed consent forms and key files should be acknowledged as important elements of research data as well.\n\n\n\nAt the VU, we sometimes use the term ‘Data Assets’. You can think of data assets as small ‘parcels’ of data that can change form or format throughout the research. For example, if you’re sending out surveys for your research, the survey responses are considered a data asset. If, in addition to the surveys, you’re also holding focus groups, the data collected from the focus group are also considered a data asset, separate from the survey results. Most projects will have more than one data asset per data stage. It is common to provide data assets based on the data stage such as raw, processed, or analysed. Raw Data refers to original data collected, Processed Data is data that has undergone some level of transformation or organisation. Processing involves cleaning, formatting, and structuring raw data to make them more understandable and suitable for analysis. Analysed Data usually results from statistical methods, detailed examination or interpretation.\nHere are some examples of data assets in research data management:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Stage\nDataset description\nType of data\nFormat\n\n\n\n\nRaw data\nInterviews\nAudio files\nMP3\n\n\n\nSpectographic analysis\nText files\nCSV\n\n\nProcessed data\nTranscription of interviews\nText files\nDocx\n\n\n\nData spreadsheet\nSPSS files\nSAV\n\n\nAnalysed data\nRegression graphic\nGraph\nPNG\n\n\n\nData table\nWord file\nDocx\n\n\nOther\nPoster presentation\nPowerpoint\nPPS\n\n\n\nProject Website\nHTML\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis code\nText files\nPython\n\n\n\nNote that these data assets also change in the different phases of the research! While the interview data are audio files in the raw stage, they are transcribed and become text files in the processed stage.\n\n\n\nThe VU DMP template consists of seven sections with questions. In DMPonline, there is guidance available for all sections, as well as example answers. When you are writing your DMP, you can consult this information directly in DMPonline. Below we provide references to information and support available for various RDM-related aspects.\n\n\nIf you have questions about working with personal data in research, please get in touch with the Privacy Champion of your faculty. The overview of Privacy Champions can be found on the VU website. Make sure to contact your Privacy Champion in the following situations:\n\nIf you need to carry out a DPIA, or if you’re unsure if you need to do one\nIf you work with special category personal data, or otherwise very sensitive data\nIf you are collaborating with other parties\nIf you need software for which no licence is set up on behalf of the VU\nIf you wish to reuse existing data containing personal data\n\nIt is impossible to provide an overview of tasks to be carried out to ensure compliance with the GDPR that fits all research projects. For that reason, it is important to contact your Privacy Champion. They will be able to identify what needs to be arranged to adhere to the GDPR.\nEthical aspects of research should be addressed in the ethics procedure of your faculty. Each faculty has their own ethics committee. The webpages of all committees are listed below. Please go to the page of the ethics committee of your faculty to find instructions for ethical review procedures for your study.\n\nACTA: ACTA Institutional Review Board (IRB)\nBeta: Research ethics review committee Faculty of Science (BETHCIE)\nFGB: Scientific and Ethical Review Board (VCWE)\nFGW: Ethische Toetsingscommissie Onderzoek (EtCO)\nFSW: Research Ethics Review Committee (RERC)\nRCH (Faculty of Law): Ethics Committee\nSBE: Research Ethics and Integrity\nVUmc: METc (Medical Ethical Review Committee)\n\n\n\n\nAn overview of storage facilities at the VU is available in the Data Storage Finder. You can use this as a starting point to navigate storage solutions.\nIf you have questions about data storage and backup, send an email to rdm@vu.nl.\n\n\n\nIf your research data contains personal data and you’re unsure about which data may be published, please contact your Privacy Champion."

Below you’ll find an explanation of how to access this template. If you need to write a DMP for funding agencies NWO, ZonMw or ERC, you can use the VU template as well.\n\n\nYou can find the VU DMP template in DMPonline. It includes concise guidance on how to complete your DMP.\nYou can select the VU template by taking the following steps (see also the picture below).\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nFor the question on primary funding organisation, select the check box on the right, saying that no funder is associated with your plan.\n\nNote: Follow these steps as well if you receive funding from NWO or ZonMw (see also below).\n\nIf you’re aiming to write a full DMP based on the VU DMP template, please make sure you don’t select the GDPR registration form.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend researchers to use the VU DMP template whenever possible, especially for researchers who work with personal data. The VU DMP template includes questions that serve as input for the GDPR record of processing activities. This means that when you write a DMP based on the VU DMP template, you simultaneousely comply with the VU requirement to register the personal data you use in your research.\nHowever, it is also possible to use other templates in DMPonline. If your funder or partner organization requires you to use a certain template, it is possible to select that template in DMPonline. Please follow the steps below to select a funder’s template.\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nIn the field under Select the primary funding organisation, start typing the name of your funder and select their template.\n\n\nResearchers who don’t work with personal data and who wish to use another DMP template than the VU template, can also follow the steps above."

This central registry lists all personal data processing activities carried out at the VU. The registry indicates why and how personal data are processed, and with whom they are shared. The registry helps the VU demonstrate compliance with the GDPR and in the case of a data breach, the registry helps with monitoring and acting swiftly to inform all relevant stakeholders.\nFor research projects, the VU registers data processing via DMPonline. You can create your registration by logging into DMPonline and following the following instructions:\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nFor the question on primary funding organisation, select the check box on the right, saying that no funder is associated with your plan.\n\n\nOnce you get to the two VU templates, you can fill in the VU DMP template 2021 v1.4 if you need to write a DMP anyway; the information you include in this DMP template will be used for the registry. If you don’t need to write a (new) DMP, you can use the separate VU GDPR registration form for research v1.1.
