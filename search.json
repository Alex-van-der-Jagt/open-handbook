If you are in need of specific information, you can skip ahead using the table of contents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou need a GitHub account to contribute. You can create one directly on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest and quickest way to contribute to the book is make suggested edits. On each page you will find a button reading “Edit this page” (usually on the right).\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a handbook chapter, with a red box on the right hand side of the page indicating where to find the “Edit this page” button\n\n\nWhen you click that, you will immediately be taken to GitHub to edit the text of that specific page.

You can do this by visiting the handbook page on GitHub and clicking Add file -&gt; New file.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of GitHub highlighting where to find the “New file” button\n\n\nWhen you click this button you may be asked to fork the repository. This is not a problem so go ahead!\nThe chapter itself needs to be written in Markdown. Every chapter must contain a first level heading (e.g., # Heading), which will be the chapter title. Section headings are second level headings (e.g., ## Section).\nAfter that, you are ready to submit your pull request! The reviewers will help you place the chapter in the right place of the book.1\n\n\n\nOnce you have made suggested changes, a pull request is the way for you to ask for your changes to be incorporated into the handbook. The people maintaining the handbook will review what you wrote, ask some questions, and accept or decline your contributions.\nWe recommend keeping your suggested changes small or limited in scope, and explaining why you are suggesting these changes. It is more likely your changes are included when you are fixing a typo or adding a paragraph, and less likely if you are revising the entire handbook. It is also more likely they are included if you explain why you are suggesting the changes, rather than dropping by and making edits without any context.\nIf you are adding a new chapter, it is definitely recommended to open an issue first to see whether there is a need for it (and maybe you’ll find collaborators!).\nDuring the review process you may be asked to update your changes, or revisions may be added by the people maintaining the handbook.

The Vrije Universiteit believes that government-funded research should be available free of charge to as many people as possible. To that end, the VU Library offers a guide on how to go about Open Access Publishing.\nOpen Access publishing is one component of Open Science. The European Commission has defined open science as follows: “Open Science represents a new approach to the scientific process based on cooperative work and new ways of diffusing knowledge by using digital technologies and new collaborative tools. The idea captures a systemic change to the way science and research have been carried out for the last fifty years: shifting from the standard practices of publishing research results in scientific publications towards sharing and using all available knowledge at an earlier stage in the research process”. (Definition taken from Nationaal Programma Open Science.) This includes making openly available research data, methods and documentation where possible. As such, RDM and the practices outlined in this LibGuide are a precondition of Open Science. You can read more about Open Science in the Netherlands on the website of the Nationaal Programma Open Science and join the Open Science Community Amsterdam, the community of VU employees interested in Open Science (joint with the University of Amsterdam).\n\n\n\nInstead of archiving research data in a data repository, you may choose to publish an article about your data collection. This is not necessarily common for all disciplines. Some examples of data journals where you can publish your data and dataset, are:\n\nScientific Data - Nature\nGeoscience Data Journal\nGigascience\nDataset Papers in Science\nJournal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data\nEarth System Science Data\nJournal of Open Archaeology Data\nJournal of Open Health Data\nJournal of Open Psychology Data\n\n\n\n\nA persistent identifier (PID) is a durable reference to a digital dataset document, website or other object. It is a kind of ISBN for digital files. By using a persistent identifier, you make sure that your dataset will be findable well into the future. A DOI or Handle are the commonly used PIDs. The data archiving options at the VU commonly offer DOIs.\nMost data archives or repositories offer a persistent identifier and generate this automatically when research data are archived. For example, this is the case for DataverseNL at the VU. In Yoda at the VU, assigning a PID is possible, but does not happen automatically. Please get in touch with the RDM Support Desk if you have questions about assigning a PID when you archive data in Yoda.\n\n\n\nA data licence agreement is a legal instrument that lets others know what they can and cannot do with your research data (and any documentation. scripts and metadata that are published with the data). It is important to consider what kind of limitations are relevant. An important component can be a guideline on how people should cite the dataset. Other components could be:\n\nCan people make copies or even distribute copies\nWho should be contacted if you need access to re-use data\nEtc.\n\nIn principle, Dataverse allows you to choose your terms of use. Some data repositories require you to use a certain licence if you want to deposit your data with them. At Dryad, for example, all datasets are published under the terms of Creative Commons Zero to minimise legal barriers and to maximise the impact for research and education. Some funders may also require that you publish the data as open data. Open data are data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share alike (Open Knowledge International definition).

Giving it a licence helps others to figure out what they can and can’t do with it.\nIf you are reusing software or libraries written by someone else, you must stick to the clauses of the licence given to the original software/library;\nIf you used proprietary software to write your code (e.g. SPSS syntax), your options in choosing a licence will probably be limited;\nWhen choosing a licence, do not just think about what others may do with the software, but also what you might want to do with the software in the future.\n\nThere are several tools that can help you to choose a suitable sotware licence.

    "text": "A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document outlining how research data will be handled throughout the research lifecycle. A DMP is a structured way to address data collection, organization, storage, sharing, and preservation. It also outlines the measures taken to ensure data security and addresses how data will be preserved and made available for future use.\n\n\n\nVU Amsterdam offers the online tool DMPonline for writing Data Management Plans. DMPonline is a platform that offers a range of templates, ensuring that researchers can create DMPs to meet the standards of diverse funders and institutions associated with their projects. DMPonline makes it easy to work on a DMP together with colleagues, advisors, or other stakeholders. VU Amsterdam researchers can use the request feedback function of DMPonline to get their DMP reviewed by a faculty data steward or RDM Support Desk colleague.\nIf you have questions about DMPonline, or encounter problems when using the tool, please get in touch with rdm@vu.nl.\n\n\n\nVarious templates exist in which you can set up your DMP. We strongly recommend that you use the VU template, which is called VU DMP template 2021 (NWO & ZonMw certified) v1.4. Below you’ll find an explanation of how to access this template. If you need to write a DMP for funding agencies NWO, ZonMw or ERC, you can use the VU template as well.\n\n\nYou can find the VU DMP template in DMPonline. It includes concise guidance on how to complete your DMP.\nYou can select the VU template by taking the following steps (see also the picture below).\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nFor the question on primary funding organisation, select the check box on the right, saying that no funder is associated with your plan.\n\nNote: Follow these steps as well if you receive funding from NWO or ZonMw (see also below).\n\nIf you’re aiming to write a full DMP based on the VU DMP template, please make sure you don’t select the GDPR registration form.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend researchers to use the VU DMP template whenever possible, especially for researchers who work with personal data. The VU DMP template includes questions that serve as input for the GDPR record of processing activities. This means that when you write a DMP based on the VU DMP template, you simultaneousely comply with the VU requirement to register the personal data you use in your research.\nHowever, it is also possible to use other templates in DMPonline. If your funder or partner organization requires you to use a certain template, it is possible to select that template in DMPonline. Please follow the steps below to select a funder’s template.\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nIn the field under Select the primary funding organisation, start typing the name of your funder and select their template.\n\n\nResearchers who don’t work with personal data and who wish to use another DMP template than the VU template, can also follow the steps above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your research is subject to the GDPR, then you need to register information on your research in a central VU registry. This central registry lists all personal data processing activities carried out at the VU. The registry indicates why and how personal data are processed, and with whom they are shared. The registry helps the VU demonstrate compliance with the GDPR and in the case of a data breach, the registry helps with monitoring and acting swiftly to inform all relevant stakeholders.\nFor research projects, the VU registers data processing via DMPonline. You can create your registration by logging into DMPonline and following the following instructions:\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nFor the question on primary funding organisation, select the check box on the right, saying that no funder is associated with your plan.\n\n\nOnce you get to the two VU templates, you can fill in the VU DMP template 2021 v1.4 if you need to write a DMP anyway; the information you include in this DMP template will be used for the registry. If you don’t need to write a (new) DMP, you can use the separate VU GDPR registration form for research v1.1. Your faculty’s Privacy Champion can help you with your registration.\nIf your research is primarily led by Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc, your research will be registered using their own separate system.\n\n\n\nIf you use personal data in your research, you should register your data processing activities before you start data collection. If you are not sure whether your research data are subject to the GDPR, contact your faculty’s Privacy Champion. Your privacy champion can also assist you if your research is already running, but has not yet been registered.\n\n\n\n\nResearch data is any information that has been collected, observed, generated or created to validate original research findings. Examples of data could be interview recordings, experiment results, physical measurement, notes from focus group’s meetings, notes from fieldwork, observations captured in photographs, film or audio, text files extracted from a corpus, image of archival items or artworks, scraped websites, responses to survey questions. Algorithms, simulations, code, scripts and software are often also considered as research data. There is also physical data: (biological) samples, collections, artifacts etc.\nAdministrative documents, like informed consent forms and key files should be acknowledged as important elements of research data as well.\n\n\n\n[https://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/dmp?#s-lg-box-wrapper-15125649 &gt; Elisa has another look at the table description, because it is quite brief]\nData assets are types of data, information collected or generated in the course of research activities. It is common to provide data assets based on the data stage such as raw, processed, or analyzed. Raw Data refers to original data collected, Processed Data is data that has undergone some level of transformation or organization. Processing involves cleaning, formatting, and structuring raw data to make it more understandable and suitable for analysis. Analyzed Data usually results from statistical methods, detailed examination or interpretation.\nHere are some examples of data assets in research data management:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Stage\nDataset description\nType of data\nFormat\n\n\n\n\nRaw data\nInterviews\nAudio files\nMP3\n\n\n\nSpectographic analysis\nText files\nCSV\n\n\nProcessed data\nTranscription of interviews\nWord files\nDocx\n\n\n\nData spreadsheet\nSPSS files\nSAV\n\n\nAnalysed data\nRegression graphic\nPhotoshop files\nPSD\n\n\n\nData table\nWord file\nDocx\n\n\nOther\nPoster presentation\nPowerpoint\nPPS\n\n\n\nProject Website\nHTML\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe VU DMP template consists of seven sections with questions. In DMPonline, there is guidance available for all sections, as well as example answers. When you are writing your DMP, you can consult this information directly in DMPonline. Below we provide references to information and support available for various RDM-related aspects.\n\n\nIf you have questions about working with personal data in research, please get in touch with the Privacy Champion of your faculty. The overview of Privacy Champions can be found on the VU website. Make sure to contact your Privacy Champion in the following situations:\n\nIf you need to carry out a DPIA, or if you’re unsure if you need to do one\nIf you work with special category personal data, or otherwise very sensitive data\nIf you are collaborating with other parties\nIf you need software for which no licence is set up on behalf of the VU\nIf you wish to reuse existing data containing personal data\n\nIt is impossible to provide an overview of tasks to be carried out to ensure compliance with the GDPR that fits all research projects. For that reason, it is important to contact your Privacy Champion. They will be able to identify what needs to be arranged to adhere to the GDPR.\nEthical aspects of research should be addressed in the ethics procedure of your faculty. Each faculty has their own ethics committee. The webpages of all committees are listed below. Please go to the page of the ethics committee of your faculty to find instructions for ethical review procedures for your study.\n\nACTA: ACTA Institutional Review Board (IRB)\nBeta: Research ethics review committee Faculty of Science (BETHCIE)\nFGB: Scientific and Ethical Review Board (VCWE)\nFGW: Ethische Toetsingscommissie Onderzoek (EtCO)\nFSW: Research Ethics Review Committee (RERC)\nRCH (Faculty of Law): Ethics Committee\nSBE: Research Ethics and Integrity\nVUmc: METc (Medical Ethical Review Committee)\n\n\n\n\nAn overview of storage facilities at the VU is available in the Data Storage Finder. You can use this as a starting point to navigate storage solutions.\nIf you have questions about data storage and backup, send an email to rdm@vu.nl.\n\n\n\nIf your research data contains personal data and you’re unsure about which data may be published, please contact your Privacy Champion."

    "text": "Various templates exist in which you can set up your DMP. We strongly recommend that you use the VU template, which is called VU DMP template 2021 (NWO & ZonMw certified) v1.4. Below you’ll find an explanation of how to access this template. If you need to write a DMP for funding agencies NWO, ZonMw or ERC, you can use the VU template as well.\n\n\nYou can find the VU DMP template in DMPonline. It includes concise guidance on how to complete your DMP.\nYou can select the VU template by taking the following steps (see also the picture below).\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nFor the question on primary funding organisation, select the check box on the right, saying that no funder is associated with your plan.\n\nNote: Follow these steps as well if you receive funding from NWO or ZonMw (see also below).\n\nIf you’re aiming to write a full DMP based on the VU DMP template, please make sure you don’t select the GDPR registration form.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend researchers to use the VU DMP template whenever possible, especially for researchers who work with personal data. The VU DMP template includes questions that serve as input for the GDPR record of processing activities. This means that when you write a DMP based on the VU DMP template, you simultaneousely comply with the VU requirement to register the personal data you use in your research.\nHowever, it is also possible to use other templates in DMPonline. If your funder or partner organization requires you to use a certain template, it is possible to select that template in DMPonline. Please follow the steps below to select a funder’s template.\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nIn the field under Select the primary funding organisation, start typing the name of your funder and select their template.\n\n\nResearchers who don’t work with personal data and who wish to use another DMP template than the VU template, can also follow the steps above."

    "text": "If your research is subject to the GDPR, then you need to register information on your research in a central VU registry. This central registry lists all personal data processing activities carried out at the VU. The registry indicates why and how personal data are processed, and with whom they are shared. The registry helps the VU demonstrate compliance with the GDPR and in the case of a data breach, the registry helps with monitoring and acting swiftly to inform all relevant stakeholders.\nFor research projects, the VU registers data processing via DMPonline. You can create your registration by logging into DMPonline and following the following instructions:\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nFor the question on primary funding organisation, select the check box on the right, saying that no funder is associated with your plan.\n\n\nOnce you get to the two VU templates, you can fill in the VU DMP template 2021 v1.4 if you need to write a DMP anyway; the information you include in this DMP template will be used for the registry. If you don’t need to write a (new) DMP, you can use the separate VU GDPR registration form for research v1.1. Your faculty’s Privacy Champion can help you with your registration.\nIf your research is primarily led by Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc, your research will be registered using their own separate system.\n\n\n\nIf you use personal data in your research, you should register your data processing activities before you start data collection. If you are not sure whether your research data are subject to the GDPR, contact your faculty’s Privacy Champion. Your privacy champion can also assist you if your research is already running, but has not yet been registered."

It is common to provide data assets based on the data stage such as raw, processed, or analyzed. Raw Data refers to original data collected, Processed Data is data that has undergone some level of transformation or organization. Processing involves cleaning, formatting, and structuring raw data to make it more understandable and suitable for analysis. Analyzed Data usually results from statistical methods, detailed examination or interpretation.\nHere are some examples of data assets in research data management:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Stage\nDataset description\nType of data\nFormat\n\n\n\n\nRaw data\nInterviews\nAudio files\nMP3\n\n\n\nSpectographic analysis\nText files\nCSV\n\n\nProcessed data\nTranscription of interviews\nWord files\nDocx\n\n\n\nData spreadsheet\nSPSS files\nSAV\n\n\nAnalysed data\nRegression graphic\nPhotoshop files\nPSD\n\n\n\nData table\nWord file\nDocx\n\n\nOther\nPoster presentation\nPowerpoint\nPPS\n\n\n\nProject Website\nHTML"
