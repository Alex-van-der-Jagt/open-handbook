We strongly recommend you to use the VU template, which is called VU DMP template 2021 (NWO & ZonMw certified) v1.4. Below is explained how to use this template. If you need to write a DMP for funding agencies NWO, ZonMw or ERC, you can use the VU template as well.\n\n1.3.1 VU template\nYou can find the VU DMP template in DMPonline. It includes concise guidance on how to complete your DMP.\nYou can select the VU template by taking the following steps (see also the picture below).\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nFor the question on primary funding organisation, select the check box on the right, saying that no funder is associated with your plan.\n\nNote: Follow these steps as well if you receive funding from NWO or ZonMw (see also below).\n\n\n\n1.3.2 GDPR registration form\nIf you’re aiming to write a full DMP based on the VU DMP template, please make sure you don’t select the GDPR registration form.\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Funder template\nWe recommend researchers to use the VU DMP template whenever possible, especially for researchers who work with personal data. VU DMP template includes questions that serve as input for the GDPR record of processing activities. This means that when you write a DMP based on the VU DMP template, you simultaneousely comply with the VU requirement to register the personal data you use in your research.\nHowever, it is also possible to use other templates in DMPonline. If your funder or partner organization requires you to use a certain template, it is possible to select that template in DMPonline. Please follow the steps below to select a funder’s template.\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as your primary research organisation.\nIn the field under Select the primary funding organisation, start typing the name of your funder and select their template.\n\n\nResearchers who don’t work with personal data and who wish to use another DMP template than the VU template, can also follow the steps above.",

This central registry lists all personal data processing activities carried out at the VU. The registry indicates why and how personal data are processed, and with whom they are shared. The registry helps organisations to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR and in the case of a data breach, the registry helps with monitoring and acting swiftly to inform all relevant stakeholders.\nFor research projects, the VU registers data processing via DMPonline. You can create your registration by logging into DMPonline and following the instructions under “Choose the right template”. Once you get to the two VU templates, you can fill in the VU DMP template if you need to write a DMP anyway and the information you include will be used for the registry. Alternatively, you can use the separate GDPR registration form if you don’t need to write a (new) DMP. Your faculty’s Privacy Champion can help you with your registration.\nIf your research is primarily led by Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc, your research will be registered using their own separate system.\n\n\n1.4.2 Register before you start your data collection\nIf you use personal data in your research, you should register your data processing activities before you start data collection. If you are not sure whether your research data are subject to the GDPR, contact your faculty’s Privacy Champion. Your privacy champion can also assist you if your research is already running, but has not yet been registered.",

The Vrije Universiteit believes that government-funded research should be available free of charge to as many people as possible. To that end, the VU Library offers a guide on how to go about Open Access Publishing.\nOpen Access publishing is one component of Open Science. The European Commission has defined open science as follows: “Open Science represents a new approach to the scientific process based on cooperative work and new ways of diffusing knowledge by using digital technologies and new collaborative tools. The idea captures a systemic change to the way science and research have been carried out for the last fifty years: shifting from the standard practices of publishing research results in scientific publications towards sharing and using all available knowledge at an earlier stage in the research process”. (Definition taken from Nationaal Programma Open Science.) This includes making openly available research data, methods and documentation where possible. As such, RDM and the practices outlined in this LibGuide are a precondition of Open Science. You can read more about Open Science in the Netherlands on the website of the Nationaal Programma Open Science and join the Open Science Community Amsterdam, the community of VU employees interested in Open Science (joint with the University of Amsterdam).",

By using a persistent identifier, you make sure that your dataset will be findable well into the future. A DOI or Handle are the commonly used PIDs. The data archiving options at the VU commonly offer DOIs.\nMost data archives or repositories offer a persistent identifier and generate this automatically when research data are archived. For example, this is the case for DataverseNL at the VU. In Yoda at the VU, assigning a PID is possible, but does not happen automatically. Please get in touch with the RDM Support Desk if you have questions about assigning a PID when you archive data in Yoda.",

It is important to consider what kind of limitations are relevant. An important component can be a guideline on how people should cite the dataset. Other components could be:\nCan people make copies or even distribute copies\nWho should be contacted if you need access to re-use data\nEtc.\nIn principle, Dataverse allows you to choose your terms of use. Some data repositories require you to use a certain licence if you want to deposit your data with them. At Dryad, for example, all datasets are published under the terms of Creative Commons Zero to minimise legal barriers and to maximise the impact for research and education. Some funders may also require that you publish the data as open data. Open data are data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share alike (Open Knowledge International definition). If you need help with drawing up license agreements, you can contact the IXA office.\nAdditional websites and tools:\nExplanation about copyrights and licences by a professor from Leiden University (English subtitles available)\nThe Guide to Creative Commons for Scholarly Publishing and Educational Resources by NWO, VSNU and the University and Royal Libraries\nDCC how-to guide on licensing research data, a guide that links to the Creative Commons website, where many terms are explained\nOpen Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)\nEUDAT B2SHARE license selection wizard, which Pawel Kamocki (et al) released under an open source license.",
